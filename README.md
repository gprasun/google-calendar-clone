# Google Calendar Clone

A high-fidelity Google Calendar clone built with modern web technologies. This full-stack application provides a complete calendar experience with event management, user authentication, calendar sharing, and real-time collaboration features.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL database
- npm

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd calendar
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   
   # Configure environment
   # Edit .env with your database credentials
   
   # Setup database
   npm run db:generate
   npm run db:push
   
   # Start backend server
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   
   # Start frontend development server
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3001
   - Database Studio: `npm run db:studio` (from backend directory)

## Architecture & Technology Stack

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: Session-based with secure HTTP-only sessions
- **API Design**: RESTful API with consistent response format
- **Security**: Helmet, CORS, input validation

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Webpack 5 with custom configuration
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Google Calendar theme
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Date Handling**: date-fns with timezone support

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Monorepo Structure**: Separate backend and frontend for clear separation of concerns
2. **Session-based Auth**: Secure for web applications
3. **RTK Query**: Eliminates boilerplate, provides caching and optimistic updates
4. **Prisma ORM**: Type-safe database access with excellent TypeScript integration
5. **Timezone Handling**: All dates stored in UTC, converted to user timezone on frontend

## Business Logic & Edge Cases

### Event Management

**Recurring Events**
- RRULE pattern support (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly)
- End date specification for recurring series
- Individual instance modification (planned)
- Timezone-aware recurrence calculation

**Multi-day Events**
- Events spanning multiple days display correctly across all affected dates
- All-day events vs timed events handled separately
- Proper timezone conversion for cross-timezone events

**Overlap Handling**
- Visual stacking of overlapping events in week/day views
- Event positioning algorithm prevents UI conflicts
- Smart event truncation in month view with "more events" indicator

**Timezone Edge Cases**
- User timezone preference stored in profile
- All API communication in UTC with frontend conversion
- Daylight saving time transitions handled automatically
- Date selection fixes prevent timezone-related date shifts

### Calendar Sharing & Permissions

**Access Control**
- Owner, Editor, Viewer roles with appropriate permissions
- Shared calendars appear in separate "Other calendars" section
- Calendar-specific event filtering and creation

**Participant Management**
- Email-based participant invitations
- RSVP status tracking (Pending, Accepted, Declined, Tentative)
- Real-time status updates via API mutations
- Participant response UI in both Event Modal and Agenda View

### Data Consistency

**Session Management**
- Automatic session cleanup on logout
- RTK Query cache reset prevents stale data
- Session persistence across browser refreshes

**Optimistic Updates**
- Immediate UI updates with automatic rollback on failure
- Background synchronization with server state
- Conflict resolution for concurrent modifications

## Animations & Interactions

### UI/UX Implementation

**Smooth Transitions**
- Framer Motion for modal animations and page transitions
- CSS transitions for hover states and interactive elements
- Loading states with skeleton screens

**Interactive Elements**
- Hover effects on calendar cells and events
- Click-to-create events on time slots
- Drag-and-drop event creation (visual feedback)
- Responsive design with touch-friendly mobile interface

**Visual Feedback**
- Toast notifications for user actions
- Color-coded event categories matching Google Calendar palette
- Status indicators for RSVP responses
- Loading spinners and disabled states during API calls

### Performance Optimizations

**Frontend Performance**
- Code splitting with Webpack for smaller initial bundles
- Efficient Redux selectors to minimize unnecessary updates

**Backend Performance**
- Pagination for large event lists
- Efficient date range queries with proper filtering
- 
## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
